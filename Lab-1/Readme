Python program to use psutil and implement a network socket monitoring tool that can check how many TCP sockets are being created by a web application.

Requirements
 
1. Create a Python script called socket-mon.py.
2. List all processes that have any socket connections (meaning the laddr and raddr fields exist).
3. Group by the PID and sort the output by the number of the connections per process.

Output in CSV format on Terminal

$ python socket-mon.py (or $ sudo python socket-mon.py)
"pid","laddr","raddr","status"
"1234","10.0.0.1@48776","93.186.135.91@80","ESTABLISHED"
"1234","10.0.0.1@48777","93.186.135.91@80","ESTABLISHED"
"5678","10.0.0.1@48779","193.286.35.91@8000","CLOSING"

A new file is created named "SocketConnections" with the output.
