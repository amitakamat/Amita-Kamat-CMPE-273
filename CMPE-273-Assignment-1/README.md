# CMPE-273-Assignment-1

As explained by Professor in the lecture, only yml files are added to the repository. 
https://github.com/amitakamat/assignment1-config-example


The app will :
1. Fetch and display yml content when .yml filename is passed.
2. Fetch yml and convert it to json when .json filename is passed.
3. Will give error message if any file other than .yml or .json is passed.
4. Will give error message if any file name other than those in repository is passed.
5. Stores the content from github repository in a local copy in v1 folder to show content if the server is down. The latest (last seen) content would be displayed.
